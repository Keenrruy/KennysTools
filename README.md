This repository contains two separate Chrome browser extensions:

- **note-taker/**: A simple note-taking extension.
- **youtube-downloader/**: A YouTube video downloader extension (UI template only).

Each extension has its own folder with a template to help you get started. See the individual README.md files in each folder for setup and development instructions.
