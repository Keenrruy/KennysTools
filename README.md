# KennysTools
Repo for planned applications/extensions i'd like to create for the sake of learning or personal hobby.

**Planned Tools**
- Flexible browser based notes app (Learning html, css, react, extension creation, local database)
- Browser extension for downloading youtube videos in different formats, at various timestamps (Saving time for content creation)
